## How to run
Be sure to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) up and running on your machine. 

### Running the backend service 
In the `service` folder run `npm i` followed by `node server.js`.

### Running the frontend app
In the `frontend` folder run `npm i` followed by `npm run start`. 

Now you can head out to http://localhost:3000/ and you should see the app running. 

## Libraries
Libraries used:
- Express JS for routing
- Material UI (mostly for the  table; should have used Chakra UI)
- react-error-boundary
